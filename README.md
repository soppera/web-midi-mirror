# web-midi-mirror

This web application mirrors a MIDI keyboard so that low-pitch keys are on the right hand side of the keyboard and high-pitch keys are on the left hand side.

It is based on [WebMIDI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MIDIAccess#Browser_compatibility) which is, as of today (2019-06), only supported by Chrome.
